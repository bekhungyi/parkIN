# ParkIN 
A P2P platform that connects drivers with available parking spaces.

ParkIN allows residents to rent out their unused parking spaces to drivers who need convenient parking near shopping malls, workplace or public transportation hubs.

By utilizing the available spaces within residential areas, ParkIN provides an efficient solution for drivers, especially working class/students during peakhours, helping them save time and avoid the hassle of searching for parking.

ParkIN aims to increase accesibility & affordability of parking spaces, while offering a passive income stream for property owners with extra parking spaces.
